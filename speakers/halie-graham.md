bio: Halie hails from Georgia where she got her start at SCAD and caught the
  production bug. With a background in fine art and design, she takes creativity
  to every bid, chat, and board. After starting in fashion then sports at Time
  Inc., she crash landed in tabletop production and has been marinating in 'bots
  & rigs ever since. Driven with a deep understanding of line production, she
  has taken a modern approach to EP'ing that can often be felt in the hallowed
  halls of The Garage.
