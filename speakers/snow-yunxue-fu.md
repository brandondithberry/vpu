  Snow Yunxue Fu is an international New Media artist, Curator, & Assistant Arts
  Professor at New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Institute of
  Emerging Media, Department of Photo and Imaging. Prior to joining NYU in 2019,
  she taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), University of
  Illinois at Chicago (UIC), China Academy of Art (CAA), etc. She obtained a
  Master of Fine Art Degree (2014) from the Film, Video, New Media, and
  Animation department at SAIC, a Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA) Degree (2012) in
  Studio Art from SAIC, another BFA (2011) in Painting from Southeast Missouri

  Normal University in China.




  Using topographical computer-rendered images and installations, her practice merges historical, post-photographic, philosophical, and painterly explorations into the universal aesthetic and definitive nature of the techno sublime. With a background in painting, Fu remains the youngest artist collected by the National Art Museum of China. Her work has also been collected by the Currents Museum of Art in New York. She sees her transition into new media as a natural extension of her conceptual research in which she draws parallels between the physical, metaphysical, digital, and multi-dimensional spaces. Fuâ€™s artwork has been shown internationally in solo shows, group exhibitions, screenings, and festivals including Venice Architecture Biennale, Ludwig Museum, the New York Gallery of Chinese Art, Pioneer Works, NADA Art Fair, Sedition, Arebyte Gallery, Shenzhen Independent Animation Biennale, Thoma Art House, Currents Santa Fe New Media Art Festival, The Wrong Biennale, etc.
