  Barry Williams currently serves as the Director of Creative Technologies at
  Trilith Studios.  Previously, Williams served as the Chief Creative Officer at
  Kefi as well as Creative Director for several large Atlanta-based
  projects.  Before his work in Atlanta, Barry served as a Key Creative, Visual
  Effects Supervisor, and Digital Environments Supervisor at Lucasfilm’s
  Industrial Light & Magic.  In his 18 years at Lucasfilm, he served as a key
  creative and supervisor on over 20 feature films.  In addition to providing

  At Lucasfilm, Williams worked closely with directors and clients to bring their ideas to life through the highest quality visual storytelling.  In his role as Key Creative and Supervisor, Williams was hands-on in the design, visualization, and creation of many of the physical and digital worlds needed to bring a story to life.   Along with creative oversight, Williams was also part of the LED stage team; creating the highest quality “loads” for real-time playback on LED stages.  Williams also managed large teams of artists across the world. 


  At Kefi, Barry has been responsible for all creative elements needed to immerse customers into large, physical, and digital experiences.  This involved interacting with architecture, brand strategy, physical set builds, digital content, and technology.  His hands-on work included the design of each large physical space, immersive experiences, and digital content.
